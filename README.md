# An analysis of kickstarter campaigns
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine trends within the kickstarter campaign industry, specifically for theaters and plays. 
There are a few ways in which we will examine these trends in this analysis. 
One is to evaluate and compare how well campaigns performed based on the time of year when they were launched. 
A second evaluation will examine percentages that were successful versus those that failed or canceled in comparison to initial financial goals set. 
Two questions when examining this data will be to see if any trends exist as to what time of year a campaign launches as to how successful it may be and the other question will ask if there is a trend in how well a campaign performs compared to how lofty of a revenue goal it set. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In examining Figure 1: Theater Outcome versus Launch, it appears that most successful theater campaigns occured when they were kickstarted in Springtime, especially May. 
Success seems to start off in January, increase into February, peak in May, and then continuously have a slow decline into wintertime. 
The highest amount of campaigns that saw success began in the springtime and the lowest number of campaigns with success kicked off in December. 
Campaigns that saw the highest levels of failures kicked off in October and through the winter. 
Logistically this makes sense, as it is likely that the general population tends to be very busy in the fall months leading up to holidays and likely don't put a lot of time or concern into booking and attending theater productions. Theater productions likely see heights of activity during summer and vacation months when families have more time for freedom, the weather is nicer, and they aren't looking to save their money away for the holidays and gifts, etc. 
When examining campaigns that failed, the numbers are pretty steady across the year and there doesn't seem to be a strong trend line one way or the other in favor of a certain time of year for when a campaign will decide to cancel.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
