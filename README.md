# An analysis of kickstarter campaigns
Perform an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends that make crowdfunding campaigns successful.

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Excel is a widely used data analytical tool because of its flexibility and ease of use as well as highly versatile. Benefits of excel include the ability to use advanced formulas, create interactive charts with graphs and pivot charts and organize data by using filters and conditional formatting. Formulas and filters allow us to visualize data in order to reveal trends. 

With Excel we can: 
* Import data into a table for analysis.
* Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas.
* Generate and interpret pivot tables.
* Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.
* Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.
* Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.
* Interpret common Excel visualizations

The purpose of this analysis is to examine trends within the kickstarter campaign industry, specifically for theaters and plays. An up and coming playwright wants to start a crowd funding campaign to help fund her play. She's estimating a budget of over $10,000 but wants to first see if that is an accurate estimate before jumping in to her first crowdfunding campaing. We can use excel to organize, sort, and analyze data to help her get a better sense of the accuracy of her project's estimate. We will analyze to see if there are specific factors that make a campaign successful. Using excel to analyze this data will help our client gather a better understanding of campaigns from start to finish to better plan her own campaign. 

There are a few ways in which we will examine these trends in this analysis. 
One is to evaluate and compare how well campaigns performed based on the time of year when they were launched. 
A second evaluation will examine percentages that were successful versus those that failed or canceled in comparison to initial financial goals set. 
Two questions when examining this data will be to see if any trends exist as to what time of year a campaign launches as to how successful it may be and the other question will ask if there is a trend in how well a campaign performs compared to how lofty of a revenue goal it set. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In examining Figure 1: Theater Outcome versus Launch, we are looking at categories of outcomes related to time of year the campaigns lauched. We want to see for example, was a campaign more successful if it started at one time of year as opposed to another. Looking at the chart below, it appears that most successful theater campaigns occured when they were kickstarted in Springtime, especially May. 
Success seems to start off in January, increase into February, peak in May, and then continuously have a slow decline into wintertime. 
The highest amount of campaigns that saw success began in the springtime and the lowest number of campaigns with success kicked off in December. 
Campaigns that saw the highest levels of failures kicked off in October and through the winter. 
Logistically this makes sense, as it is likely that the general population tends to be very busy in the fall months leading up to holidays and likely don't put a lot of time or concern into booking and attending theater productions. Theater productions likely see heights of activity during summer and vacation months when families have more time for freedom, the weather is nicer, and they aren't looking to save their money away for the holidays and gifts, etc. 
When examining campaigns that failed, the numbers are pretty steady across the year and there doesn't seem to be a strong trend line one way or the other in favor of a certain time of year for when a campaign will decide to cancel.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In examining Figure 2 Theater Outcomes versus Goals, we are examining percentage of success to failure based on various monetary goal ranges (by the thousands). In looking at the chart below, it appears that the plays that turned out to be the most successful, either had extremely feasible goals (and therefore likely appealed to the general masses who will select based on budgetary means), or they had fairly lofty goals between 35,000 to 45,000. Most campaigns that had goals over 45,000 did not fair so well. If we look at just the blue trend line that follows those that were successful, the trend starts high in the reasonable budget category and has a slow but steady decline bottoming out at 25,000 and then for some reason quickly shooting back up to higher numbers before teetering off again. In comparing this trendline to percentage of campaigns failed, almost the opposite can be said, meaning that as campaigns start out with more reasonable income goals, the percentage failing is rather low and steadily increases as the campaign goals increase. There are some outliers however in the ranges 35,000 to 45,000 that cannot really be analyzed with this particular data. It could be due to many factors and we would likely need a separate section of analysis with a pivot table looking at different data in comparison to possibly learn more on this strange phenonom around the 35,000 marker. One reason could be a luxury, nice market but again, it cannot be said for certain until different data is compared. In terms of percentage canceled, it appears that in this dataset, there were no play campaigns that were canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#### Deliverable 1 Challenges
This analysis was performed by creating a pivot table from the main Kickstarter Data Sheet. A pivot table is a helpful analysis for this data because it summarizes it in an easily viewable filtered way. The data became filtered down to focus only on theater campaigns at different times of year. Launch dates became the row while outcomes became the column and the number of outcomes was treated as a value. While I had no issues filtering this data, setting up the pivot chart, and creating a graph that easily depicts the data, I did notice that there were a few campaigns who were still acting as a live. These few live campaigns possibly could skew the data as they can't quite be considered relevant yet, as they have not yet either failed or been successful. Possible challenges and difficulties that could be easily found in this visualization creation might be issue of considering what values to place in which areas of the pivot chart. For example, one might struggle with deciding what fields to put in the columns versus rows, which to decide to count the value of, and which fields to filter on. Other possible difficulties could have been found in attempting to group the data together so that years and quarters did not show, and only months of the year showed. While I did not struggle with these scenarios, had they happened, they could have been solved with trial and error as well as mapping out potential math thoughts and attempting to understand the logics behind what we were attempting to dispaly first. Also google, youtube, and the microsoft platform itself are great resources for help when trying to understand how to solve data issues in excel. 

#### Deliverable 2 Challenges
While I did not encounter any challenges in the first dataset, the second Figure and charting with the COUNTIF() Function, was quite a learning curve for me. It took some time and was rather tedious to first create all the monetary ranges and make sure that I entered in all the numbers correctly. Then it took me a while to figure out that I needed to place a $ sign in front of the excel range that was being classified so that the formula could be transferred on correctly. It was also extremely tedious to make sure that each column had it's category of "successful", "failed", or "canceled" correctly inputted in the formula, as well as make sure we were filtering down to "plays" for all the subcategories. Making sure all the <= or >= were inputted properly was also difficult. I was able to overcome these challenges by just having patience with myself, watching videos and reading microsoft articles, sitting back to try and understand what it was I was plotting, and then starting all over. Once I was able to overcome this mental hurdle, the formula began to make a lot more sense to me, and once the data was all reflected and a line chart was plotted, it was much easier to see the benefit of this particular function. The function allows us to a certain particular instance happened, based on other further constraints. By summing the total projects from each category, we were then able to view the percentage of each that was successful versus failed or canceled based on the goals that were set. This is a lot of data to manipulate and analyze and a handy excel formula made it all possible. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that: 
1) Time of year matters for launching a campaign, especially in regards to theatrical plays. 
2) Campaigns that see the most success tend to start in early springtime, peaking in May and slowy wind down to seeing their lowest levels in wintertime. This makes sense as plays and theaters most often occur in summertime and so they will generate the majority of their interest in the months leading up to summer. Campaigns also saw higher levels of failure in the spring and summer months, which could be due to just the higher number of campaigns kickstarting then anyways. Campaigns also had higher failure rates in October and fall. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After analyzing the dataset, we can conclude that campaigns for theatrical plays will have a corresponding correlation with the level of monetary goals set. Campaigns that had more achievable goals tended to have higher success rates while the more increasingly lofty the moentary goals became, the higher the level of failures came and the lower the number of successful campaigns. Therefore we can conclude there is generally a correspending negative relationship between financial goals set and the success of the campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?: 
There are actually quite a few limitations to this dataset. For example, when I saw the outliers in Figure 2 where the success went up between the finanacial ranges of 30,000 to 45,000 and then back down after, I couldn't help but think that we were missing some sort of demographic and possibly geographic data to explain this occurrance. It would be interesting to filter down even further by city, by type of plays (comedies, tragedies), time of year, and then demographic data of those purchasing tickets. Limitations of the first data set might be the price of the tickets, again the geographic location like the data, the type of play, the age of the ticket purchasers, and also the type of play. 
There is also a limitation of the data analysis that we are performing. For example, even though we can see general trend lines in the line charts, we can't actually yet perform a statistical analysis to determine how strong a correlation of the dataset we might have. For example, while we can see that it seems there is a negative correlation between financial goals set and success of a campaign, we don't yet have an actual statistical measure to say how truly strong that correlation is or not. Further analysis like a regression analysis could be used if we can plot the data on a regression line. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?: 
Other possible tables and graphs that we could create might be pivot charts that examine pledged amounts with goals set and number of backers. This data would also be interesting to compare with percentage funded and average donation. Also how long a compaign was on open for (it's launch date versus it's deadline date) would be interesting to see how that correlated with outcome and potential success or failure. Country compared with average donation, monetary goal set, and actual pledged amount would be interesting to see if different countries have higher monetary amounts collected. For example, if you create a pivot chart that views success of campaigns compared with country, you can see that the two countries that have the most success with theater campaigns are the US and Great Britain. You could also chart percent funded, or amount pledged in comparison to financial goal set and see if the price set as the goal had any relationship with the amount or percentage that actually came through.
